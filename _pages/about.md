I am a master student at HUST [Data Storage and Application Lab](http://stlab.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/index.jsp) advised by Wei Tong. My major is computer architecture. Before that, I received my B.E degree in Network Engineering in 2021 from [School Of QingHu](http://qhxy.ncu.edu.cn/xygk/xyjs/index.htm), Nanchang University
where I was advised by [Zichen Xu](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/Pages/Professor.html).


### Research and Projects
I am interested in storage systems, especially KV stores. My current research focuses on designing a compaction scheme for LSMT-based KV stores to reduce write amplification. In addition, I have participated in a computational storage project collaborating with Huawei. In the project, we designed an object interface-based computational storage device and accelerated Spark SQL by offloading select statements to the device.

### Publications

- **Biyong Liu**, Yuan Xia, Xueliang Wei, Wei  Tong, "LifetimeKV: Narrowing the Lifetime Gap of SSTs in LSMT-Based KV Stores for ZNS SSDs". is accepted by 41th IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD), 2023.

- Denghui Wu, **Biyong Liu**, Wei Zhao, Wei Tong, "ZNSKV: Reducing Data Migration in LSMT-Based KV Stores on ZNS SSDs" is accepted by 40th IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD), 2022.

<!-- &ensp;&ensp;In this paper, we propose our ZNS SSD based KV store ZNSKV to reduce the redundant data migration in garbage collection and LSMT compaction.  -->


- Tao Zeng, Zichen Xu, Dan Wu, Xiaoling Li, **Biyong Liu**, et al, "Exploring nonintrusive measurements of spatio-temporal portrait of microservices". is accepted by Software: Practice and Experience (SPE)  Preprint, 27 June 2023.


- Xiaoling Li, Tao Zeng, **Biyong Liu**, et al, "Nonintrusive Measurement on Temporal and Spatial Features of Microservice Inferences" is accepted by 19th IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing (UIC), 2022.

<!-- &ensp;&ensp;In this paper, we propose a framework to provide nonintrusive measurements on microservice inference (MEME), to detect fraudulent behaviors of cloud service providers on microservice-based applications. (My undergraduate thesis) -->
