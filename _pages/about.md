I am a master student at HUST [Data Storage and Application Lab](http://stlab.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/index.jsp) advised by Wei Tong. My major is computer architecture. Before that, I received my B.E degree in Network Engineering in 2021 from [School Of QingHu](http://qhxy.ncu.edu.cn/xygk/xyjs/index.htm), Nanchang University
where I was advised by [Zichen Xu](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/Pages/Professor.html).


### Research and Projects
I am interested in storage systems, especially KV stores. In the past, I have been trying to design a new LSMT-based KV store on ZNS SSD to reduce write amplification. My current research focuses on designing a new Replica management mechanism for distributed LSMT-based KV stores to reduce compaction overhead. In addition, I have participated in a computational storage project corporating with Huawei. In the project, we designed an object interface-based computational storage device and accelerated Spark SQL by offloading select statements to the device.
